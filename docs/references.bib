% Rules for references:
% - IEEE citation style.
% - Make sure all references are complete and accurate! Don't rely solely on the BibTeX you get from the web or reference management applications (e.g., Zotero and Mendeley).
% - Avoid grey literature (e.g. webpages, blogs, whitepapers, opinion articles) and give preference to references that are indexed (e.g. Scopus, WoS, and DBLP). Grey literature may be mentioned as URLs in footnotes.• Maintain consistence in the presentation of the references regarding the name and surname of authors. If names are provided, ensure that all
references include this information.
% e.g. D. Silva, Tiago Azevedo, and António Costa (2023), … (avoid this!).
% e.g. D. Silva, T. Azevedo, and A. Costa (2023), … (prefer this style, see IEEE reference manual).
% In BibTex, the field "address" is related to the publisher address, not the conference or event! The address of the events can be included in the (sub)title of the proceedings.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design—in addition to the scientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.},
