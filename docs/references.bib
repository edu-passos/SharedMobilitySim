% Rules for references:
% - IEEE citation style.
% - Make sure all references are complete and accurate! Don't rely solely on the BibTeX you get from the web or reference management applications (e.g., Zotero and Mendeley).
% - Avoid grey literature (e.g. webpages, blogs, whitepapers, opinion articles) and give preference to references that are indexed (e.g. Scopus, WoS, and DBLP). Grey literature may be mentioned as URLs in footnotes.• Maintain consistence in the presentation of the references regarding the name and surname of authors. If names are provided, ensure that all
references include this information.
% e.g. D. Silva, Tiago Azevedo, and António Costa (2023), … (avoid this!).
% e.g. D. Silva, T. Azevedo, and A. Costa (2023), … (prefer this style, see IEEE reference manual).
% In BibTex, the field "address" is related to the publisher address, not the conference or event! The address of the events can be included in the (sub)title of the proceedings.
