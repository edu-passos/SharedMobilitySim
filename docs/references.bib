abstract = {In this paper, we present a comprehensive, in-depth survey of the literature on reinforcement learning approaches to decision optimization problems in a typical ridesharing system. Papers on the topics of rideshare matching, vehicle repositioning, ride-pooling, routing, and dynamic pricing are covered. Most of the literature has appeared in the last few years, and several core challenges are to continue to be tackled: model complexity, agent coordination, and joint optimization of multiple levers. Hence, we also introduce popular data sets and open simulation environments to facilitate further research and development. Subsequently, we discuss a number of challenges and opportunities for reinforcement learning research on this important domain.}

abstract = {Dockless micromobility services, including shared bicycles and scooters, are emerging as sustainable travel alternatives in many cities. The optimal operation of these services, however, often depends on rebalancing operations that redistribute micromobility vehicles to service area locations with less than desired vehicle levels. Existing rebalancing models typically prioritize operational efficiency or business objectives, such as relocating vehicles to maximize served demand or profits. This study contributes a rebalancing model that incorporates the goal of improving equity-in-access to dockless micromobility through rebalancing operations. Specifically, a two-step approach is proposed to optimize the rebalancing operations of dockless micromobility services according to efficiency and equity objectives. In the first step, an optimization model is used to find micromobility vehicle distributions that maximize system-level efficiency and equity performance indicators across a specified time horizon. In the second step, a multi-objective pick-up and delivery problem is used to develop vehicle relocation plans aimed at achieving the optimal distributions determined in the first step. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the proposed methods. As part of the numerical tests, machine learning-based models trained using real-world data were shown to accurately predict equity-based performance indicators for a dockless e-scooter service in Puerto Rico.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design—in addition to the scientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.},
